                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Foxx Golf Works was founded in 2018 by Zach Foxx, a PGA professional with over 20 years of
                        experience in club building and fitting. What started as a passion project in a small garage
                        workshop has grown into a respected custom club building operation serving golfers across the
                        country.</p>
                    <p>Our philosophy is simple: every golfer deserves equipment that is precisely matched to their
                        unique swing characteristics and playing style. We believe that properly fitted equipment not
                        only improves performance but also enhances the enjoyment of the game.</p>
                    <p>At Foxx Golf Works, we combine traditional craftsmanship with modern technology to create golf
                        clubs that deliver exceptional performance. Each club is meticulously built by hand with
                        attention to every detail from component selection to final assembly.</p>

                    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
                    <p>We take a data-driven approach to club building, utilizing launch monitor technology and
                        comprehensive swing analysis to determine the optimal specifications for each golfer. Our
                        fitting process accounts for swing speed, attack angle, path tendencies, and release patterns to
                        identify the perfect combination of components.</p>
                    <p>Unlike mass-produced clubs that conform to standardized specifications, our custom builds are
                        tailored to enhance your natural swing rather than forcing you to adapt to ill-fitting
                        equipment. The result is more consistent ball striking, improved accuracy, and greater distance
                        with less effort.</p>

                    <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
                    <p>Every club that leaves our workshop carries our commitment to quality and performance. We stand
                        behind our craftsmanship and only use components from manufacturers who share our dedication to
                        excellence.</p>
                    <p>We're not just club builders â€“ we're passionate golfers ourselves. We understand the difference
                        that properly fitted equipment can make, and we're committed to helping golfers of all skill
                        levels perform their best on the course.</p>
